# Low-Poly-Game-Kit-Vita-
The Low Poly Game Kit from the Unity Marketplace Ported to run on the PS VITA.

ONLY WORKS WITH Unity 2018.2.19f1 That has PS Vita Exports Enabled.

Whats Here:
- This is a baseline for your next game, Its a great template to start at and the goal for this is
to get this template running near perfect on the vita, so only optimizations you will need to do
is anything new you add to the game.
- A Low Poly Art style that should run very well on the vita.
- Currently runs in Mode B
- Basic controls that work with the Vita are already there.


To Do:

- Adjust lighting
- Adjust the scenes resource usage
- Make the FPS not only playable but stable.
- More in depth "To Do" Coming soon
